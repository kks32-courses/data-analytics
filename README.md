# Course description
In this course, we will first cover the basics of using Python on data management process from data acquisition to data analytics. Spark is rapidly becoming the compute engine of choice for big data. Spark programs are more concise and often run 10-100 times faster than Hadoop MapReduce jobs. As companies realize this, Spark developers are becoming increasingly valued.

This course will teach you the basics of working with Spark and will provide you with the necessary foundation for diving deeper into Spark. You will learn about Sparkâ€™s architecture and programming model, including commonly used APIs. After completing this course, you will be able to write and debug basic Spark applications. This course will also explain how to use Spark's web user interface (UI), how to recognize common coding errors, and how to proactively prevent errors. The focus of this course will be Spark Core and Spark SQL. This course will also cover real-time data streaming and processing as well as data visualisation techniques.

## Prerequisites
* Knowledge of Unix/Linux command line and SSH.
* Python programming
